\acknowledgments{Acknowledge later}
%% If you prefer to provide "acknowledgements" instead (note the added "e"
%% between the "g" and the "m") then add the "e" in the macro name so that
%% it reads "\acknowledgements".}

%% Additional "lists" can be added to the end of the front matter using the
%% \addlistof macro.  For example:
%\addlistof{Symbols}{Insert your list of symbols here or comment out this line.}
%% Note that the command "\input{symbols}" can be used if the symbol list is
%% contained in a separate file called "symbols.tex"}

%\addlistof{Acronyms}{Insert your list of acronyms here or comment out this line}
%% Use "\input{acronyms}" if the acronym list is in a separate file called
%% "acronyms.tex".  Note that the formatting generated by the acronym package
%% can be forced into singlespaced text by inserting "\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
%% \setlength\parskip{0pt}" into the "acronym" environment.}
