\abstract  {Machine learning algorithms are integrated into many aspects of daily life. However, research into the correctness and security of these important algorithms has lagged behind experimental results and improvements. My research seeks to add to our theretical understanding of the Perceptron family of algorithms, which includes the Kernel Perceptron, Budget Kernel Perceptron, and Description Kernel Perceptron algorithms. \\ In this thesis, I will describe three variants of the Kernel Perceptron algorithm and provide both proof and performance results for verified implementations of these algorithms written in the Coq Proof Assistant. This research employs generalization error, which bounds how poorly a model may perform on unseen testing data, as a guarantee of performance with proofs verified in Coq. These implementations are also extracted to the functional language Haskell to evaluate their generalization error and performance results on real and synthetic data sets. }

\acknowledgments{In this opportunity to sit and think back on all those who have made this thesis possible, I am incredibly grateful. Dr. Gordon Stewart has been a faithful advisor for my research, and his insight and care has been instrumental in my success. His encouragement in research was a major factor in my decision to pursue my Master's degree and I am thankful for his time and attention over the years. 
\\I would also like to thank Dr. David Juedes, Dr. Razvan Bunescu, and Dr. Peter Jung for serving on my committee. I am grateful for their input and analysis of my work and how they have pushed me to do my best.
\\This thesis would not be possible without a research team that has given me support and focus over the past two years. Nathan St. Amour, David Masters, and Tim Steinberger have been fantastic lab partners and I am glad to have worked closely with them to navigate academia together. Their input and willingness to listen have helped me through many challenges.
\\Finally, I would like to thank my family for their support and love. Mom, Dad, Russ, and Shannon, thanks for all the time I've spent talking about my research, even when I didn't do a good job explaining along the way.}
%% If you prefer to provide "acknowledgements" instead (note the added "e"
%% between the "g" and the "m") then add the "e" in the macro name so that
%% it reads "\acknowledgements".}

%% Additional "lists" can be added to the end of the front matter using the
%% \addlistof macro.  For example:
%\addlistof{Symbols}{Insert your list of symbols here or comment out this line.}
%% Note that the command "\input{symbols}" can be used if the symbol list is
%% contained in a separate file called "symbols.tex"}

%\addlistof{Acronyms}{Insert your list of acronyms here or comment out this line}
%% Use "\input{acronyms}" if the acronym list is in a separate file called
%% "acronyms.tex".  Note that the formatting generated by the acronym package
%% can be forced into singlespaced text by inserting "\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
%% \setlength\parskip{0pt}" into the "acronym" environment.}
