Limitations to current MLCert research
\\O Always vacuous bounds for Kernel Perceptron
\\O Bounds for Budget/Description require many many more training examples than support set

Future Work
\\O Implement additional machine learning algorithms
\\O Modify existing algorithms to improve performance/generalization further

Contributions
\\O Haskell implementation of Kernel Perceptron, Budget Kernel Perceptron, and Description Kernel Perceptron
\\O Python implementations of Budget Kernel Perceptron
\\O Generalization bound proofs and experimental results
\\O Timing results that show comparability to more standard implementations
